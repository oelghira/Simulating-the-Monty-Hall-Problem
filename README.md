# Simulating-the-Monty-Hall-Problem :door::door::door:

I've got a masters in statistics, so I'm embarrsed to admit that I did not initially understand or trust the experts who've proven the strategy to solving the Monty Hall Problem. The mathematical proofs are rock solid, but this was a case where I trusted my feelings more so than the math.  

The Monty Hall Problem comes from the 1970's game show "Let's Make a Deal" hosted by Monty Hall. In the game "Pick-A-Door" a lucky contestant would have the chance to win a fabulous prize if they could guess which door the prize was behind. The contestant would be given 3 doors to choose from. The contestant would pick a door, then Monty would remove one of the losing doors and ask the contestant "Do you want to switch your pick to the other door or stick with your first pick?" This question is where the Monty Hall Problem comes from. The probability theorists have proven that switching your pick gives you on average a two-thirds (2/3) chance at winning. I was skeptical that switching doors was any better than staying with the original pick as there are now 2 doors with 1 winner and 1 loser. The problem seemed more like a 50/50 chance to me.  

I am one of those who had to see it to believe it, so for this project I simulated the game 1,000 times and tested both strategies (switching doors vs not switching doors) to see if there is any difference in the outcome. 

**Spoiler Alert: The strategy that was already proven is the best method to win the game**  

**can i find an actual clip of the game from the show?? turns out it is really effing hard to find an actual clip of just this game**

## R Code Simulation 
The file **file name** contains the R code I created to simulate the "Pick-A-Door" game 1,000 times. The code uses a binomial distribution in each trial/play of the game to randomly select the winning door. The code also uses another binomial distribution in each trial/play of the game to randomly assign the contestants first pick. In the case where the winning door and the door selected for the first pick are not the same, the remaining losing door is removed. In the case where the winning door is picked first another binomial distribution is used to randomly remove one of the losing doors. After the removal of the losing door in each case, both strategies are implimented. One strategy where the final pick comes from switching from the first door picked and one strategy where the final pick is the original door picked. In each trial/play of the game, only one strategy can be the correct.  

After 1,000 trials the results seem to confirm what has already been proven. Switching your pick after one of the losing doors is removed, gives nearly a two-thirds or 67% chance of winning the game.

## Hypothesis Testing  
The results displayed above support the proven theory that switching doors after a losing door has been removed is the best strategy to win the game. While a picture is worth a thousand words a hypothesis test will be worth so much more to the credibility of each strategy.  

In each trial/play of the game there are only 2 possible outcomes, selecting the right or wrong door. We also have a fixed number of trials in this case (1,000 trials/plays of the game). This is the perfect setup to use the properties of the binomial distribution for hypothesis testing. The aim of the hypothesis test is to find the true probability of winning the game for each strategy.  

### 1st Hypothesis Test:  
- **$H_0$: P(success = 0.50) vs $H_1$: P(success > 0.50)**
- In English the first hypothesis we are testing is that the probability of picking the correct door is equal to 0.50 (a 50/50 chance) compared to the alternative hypothesis that our proability of picking the correct door is greater than 0.50. We will test the observed number of correct picks in each method.  
  - **Result1 (Switching Doors Strategy):** The observed number of successes was 667. The probability of getting 667 success in 1,000 trials is nearly 0. Under $H_0$ our expected number of successes is 500 (n x p i.e. 1,000 x 0.50 due to the binomial distribution). So our p-value is much smaller than 0.05 or 0.01 and thus we have evidence to reject $H_0$ in favor of the alternative.
- **Result2 (Don't Switch Doors Strategy):** The observed number of successes was 333. The probability of getting 333 success in 1,000 trials is nearly 0. Under $H_0$ our expected number of successes is 500 (n x p i.e. 1,000 x 0.50 due to the binomial distribution). So our p-value is much smaller than 0.05 or 0.01 and thus we have evidence to reject $H_0$ in favor of the alternative.
  
### 2nd Hypothesis Test:  MIGHT WANT TO REDO THIS WITH A SET ALT HYPOTHESIS OF <0.67.............TBD
- **$H_0$: P(success = 0.67) vs $H_1$: P(success != 0.67)**
- In English the second hypothesis we are testing is that the probability of picking the correct door is equal to 0.67 (a two-thirds chance) compared to the alternative hypothesis that our proability of picking the correct door does not equal 0.67. We will test the observed number of correct picks in each method.
- **Result1 (Switching Doors Strategy):** The observed number of successes was 667. The probability of getting 667 success in 1,000 trials is approximately 42%. Under $H_0$ our expected number of successes is 670 (n x p i.e. 1,000 x 0.50 due to the binomial distribution). Our observed number of successes almost the same as our expected number. With just this result we don't have to use any statistical tests to know that our p-value is much larger than 0.05 and thus we have evidence in support of $H_0$. (Using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution our p-value is approximately 0.84. See code for details)
- **Result2 (Don't Switch Doors Strategy):** The observed number of successes was 333. Under $H_0$ our expected number of successes is 670 (n x p i.e. 1,000 x 0.50 due to the binomial distribution). Our observed number of successes is far fewer than the expected number of successes. Using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, under $H_0$ our p-value is approximately 0 (see code for details). This suggests that we have evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis that the probability of success is not 0.67. However, we know from our previous result that the observed number of 333 successes suggested that our probability of sucess is greater than 50%.  

### might have to switch to say what is the probability of success for each strategy and show a test for the dont switch doors strategy probability of success is about 1/3

We will test the observed number of correct picks in each method.

## Conclusion/How to think of the monty hall problem now  
now i think of the monty hall problem and instead of asking what is my probability of guessing right on the first guess I think what is my probability of guessing wrong? With that mindset, the probability of me guessing wrong on the first guess is 2/3rds or 0.67. After the host removes a door, the 2/3rds probability of guessing wrong is now condensed into my first guess. That means my probability of guessing right on my first try is now 1/3rd and the probability of the other door being correct is now 2/3rds (exactly what the simulation found). Thus switching is much better than sticking with my first guess.

# Simulating-the-Monty-Hall-Problem  
#### Omar El-Ghirani | Month 00th, 202X
I'm a little embarrased to admit that as a statistician I did not believe the commonly known winning strategy to the Monty Hall Problem. It's been written about, mathematically proven, and the subject of plenty of YouTube videos, and books. Call me a skeptic because I needed to see it to believe it! My goal was to simulate the game and see how does this strategy actually work and back up what the much wiser mathematical folks have already known. In this project I....  
**Spoiler Alert: The already known solution is the one that works**
## What is the Monty Hall Problem? :door::door::door:
For context the Monty Hall Problem comes from the 1970's game show "Let's Make a Deal" hosted by Monty Hall. In the game "Pick-A-Door" a lucky contestant would have the chance to win a fabulous prize, usually a new sports car. The contestant would be presented with 3 doors and had to guess which door the prize was behind. The contestant would pick a door, then Monty would remove one of the losing doors and ask the contestant "Do you want to switch your pick to the other door or stick with your first pick?" This question is where the Monty Hall Problem comes from. 

At this point where the contestant has only 2 doors to choose from the probability of winning the prize seems to be 50/50. Intuitively this makes sense and there would be no benefit to switching to the other door or sticking with your first guess. However, the mathematicians and statisticians have proven that switching your pick gives a 2/3's probability of winning the big prize. 
**can i find an actual clip of the game from the show?? turns out it is really effing hard to find an actual clip of just this game**

## How Can a 50/50 chance actually be a 1/3 to 2/3 chance?
